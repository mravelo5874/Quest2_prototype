Because we will not have access to the quest all all times |
during development, I've added two different means of	   |
playing the game. If the quest is hooked up to the project |
then the game will use the handheld\hand-tracking controls |
while playing the game. However, if no device is detected  |
then the player can use mouse\keyboard to play the game in |
the exact same way (this is mostly just for testing when   |
developing the mechanics).				   |

[complete]	- create project and github repo
[complete]	- barebones scaling mechanic for POC
not-complete 	- hook up the quest 2 with project
not-complete 	- movement using mouse\keyboard
not-complete	- movement using quest handheld devices
not-complete 	- time-perception depending on current size
not-complete 	- add moving object(s) to be able to see time-perception changes
not-complete 	- create interesting world to explore as different sizes
not-complete 	- research into LOD for objects in scene
